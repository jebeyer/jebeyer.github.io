I've been developing a demo application for an ongoing research project.

The application allows you to move dots around a sphere, and draws circles which separate the dots so that there are three on each side. 
I plan to fill in more details here in the future, but for now you can see the still-in-development application here:</br> [circles and dots](https://jebeyer.github.io/circles-and-dots/index.html)
