OU Math Department links:

* [Program Requirements](https://math.ou.edu/graduate/grad_rules)

After you've passed your quals...
* Read [On Choosing a Thesis Advisor](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201902/rnoti-p191.pdf) by Robert Lipshitz.

Advisory Conference links:
* [R. Schmidt's site](https://www2.math.ou.edu/~rschmidt/grad/procedures.html#advisory_conference) is very outdated, but might have some useful information.
* [Grad Bulletin](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms/bulletin/doctoral-info#8.3) with official guidance from the Grad College. This has all of the links you need.
* [Grad College Forms](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms), also with links for submitting forms.
* Degree checklists can be found [here](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms/doctoral-degree-requirements) and [here](https://ou-public.courseleaf.com/arts-sciences/mathematics/mathematics-doctor-philosophy/), but you should reference the math department site for a full list of requirements.
