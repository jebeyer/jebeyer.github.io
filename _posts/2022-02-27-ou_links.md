Some links that OU math grad students should know about... (updated 2023-07-31)

#### Start here:

OU Math Department:
* [Qualifying Exams](https://math.ou.edu/graduate/quals)
* [Program Requirements](https://math.ou.edu/graduate/grad_rules)

---

#### After you've passed your quals:
* Read [On Choosing a Thesis Advisor](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201902/rnoti-p191.pdf) by Robert Lipshitz.

After finding an advisor and committee, you'll have an advisory conference:
* [Steps to Degree](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms-and-policies/steps-to-degree) outlines the post-quals process.
* [Grad Bulletin](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms-and-policies/graduate-college-bulletin) with official guidance from the Grad College. This has all of the links you need.
* [Grad College Forms](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms-and-policies/forms), also with links for submitting forms.
* A degree checklist can be found on the forms page above, but you should reference the math department site for a full list of requirements.
* [Ralf Schmidt's site](http://www2.math.ou.edu/~rschmidt/grad/procedures.html) is very outdated, but has some useful department-specific information.

These links should also serve as the starting point for generals and beyond.

For the dissertation defense, there is also a memo on mzone.

#### Academic Jobs:
* [This page](https://math.duke.edu/graduate/applying-for-jobs) has some useful links and info.
* Some of the articles in the AMS Notices [Early Career](https://www.ams.org/cgi-bin/notices/amsnotices.pl?article_id=career&article_type=gallery&gallery_type=career) section might be of interest.

Job Listings:
* [MathJobs.org](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs) (This is the one.)
* [Inside Higher Ed](https://careers.insidehighered.com/), [Higher Ed Jobs](https://www.higheredjobs.com/faculty/), [The Chronicle](https://jobs.chronicle.com/), ...

#### Conferences:
* I made another page for this [here](../../../2023/01/27/conference_listings.html).
