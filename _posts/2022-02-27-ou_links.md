Some links that OU math grad students should know about... 

#### Start here

OU Math Department:
* [Qualifying Exams](https://math.ou.edu/graduate/quals)
* [Program Requirements](https://math.ou.edu/graduate/grad_rules)

---

#### After you've passed your quals:
* Read [On Choosing a Thesis Advisor](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201902/rnoti-p191.pdf) by Robert Lipshitz.

After finding an advisor and committee, you'll have an advisory conference:
* [Grad Bulletin](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms/bulletin/doctoral-info) with official guidance from the Grad College. This has all of the links you need.
* [Grad College Forms](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms), also with links for submitting forms.
* Degree checklists can be found [here](https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms/doctoral-degree-requirements) and [here](https://ou-public.courseleaf.com/arts-sciences/mathematics/mathematics-doctor-philosophy/), but you should reference the math department site for a full list of requirements.
* [Ralf Schmidt's site](http://www2.math.ou.edu/~rschmidt/grad/procedures.html) is very outdated, but might have some useful department-specific information.

These links should also serve as the starting point for generals and beyond.

For the dissertation defense, there is also a memo on mzone.

Job Listings:
* [MathJobs.org](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs) (This is the one.)
* [Inside Higher Ed](https://careers.insidehighered.com/), [Higher Ed Jobs](https://www.higheredjobs.com/faculty/), [The Chronicle](https://jobs.chronicle.com/), ...
