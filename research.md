### Mathematics

<br/>
I am currently a PhD student at the University of Oklahoma, working under the direction of [Greg Muller](https://math.ou.edu/~gmuller). My research is focused on [cluster algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_algebra), a type of commutative ring with connections to many different areas of mathematics and physics.

#### Papers

* **Deep Points of Cluster Algebras** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15589)) <br/>
   *Joint with Greg Muller* <br/>
   We initiate a systematic study of the deep points of a cluster algebra; that is, the points in the associated variety which are not in any cluster torus. We describe the deep points of cluster algebras of type A, rank 2, Markov, and unpunctured surface type.


#### In Preparation

* **Separating Dots with Circles** <br/>
   *Joint with [Jaewon Min](https://sites.google.com/view/jaewonmin/home) and Greg Muller* <br/>
   We study partitions of dots on the sphere using circles and show that this admits a natural cluster structure. 
   A demo application can be viewed [here](./circles-and-dots/index.html).

* **Separating Curves in the Genus 2 Surface and the \\( X_7 \\) Cluster Algebra** <br/>
   *Joint with Greg Muller* <br/>
   We establish a correspondence between separating curves in the genus 2 surface and a subset of cluster variables in the \\( X_7 \\) cluster algebra.

Semiprimes where the sum of the digits equals the difference between the prime factors.

#### Old Stuff

For my MS, I wrote a survey paper on the [curve complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_complex). My advisor was Leah Childers.
