### Mathematics

#### Research

I am currently a fourth-year graduate student working under the direction of [Greg Muller](https://math.ou.edu/~gmuller). My research is focused on [cluster algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_algebra).

For my MS, I wrote a survey paper on the [curve complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_complex). My advisor was Leah Childers.
