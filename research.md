### Mathematics

#### Research

My current research is focused on [cluster algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_algebra).

For my MS at Pittsburg State University, I wrote a survey paper on the [curve complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_complex). <br> My advisor was Dr. Leah Childers.
