### Mathematics

#### Research

My primary research interests are in geometry, topology, and geometric group theory. <br/> I'm also interested in dynamics and mathematical physics.

For my MS at Pittsburg State University, I wrote a survey paper on the [curve complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_complex). <br/> My advisor was Dr. Leah Childers.
