### Mathematics

<br/>
I am currently a fifth-year graduate student working under the direction of [Greg Muller](https://math.ou.edu/~gmuller). My research is focused on [cluster algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_algebra).

#### Papers

* **Deep Points of Cluster Algebras** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15589)) <br/>
   *Joint with Greg Muller* <br/>
   We initiate a systematic study of the deep points of a cluster algebra; that is, the points in the associated variety which are not in any cluster torus. We describe the deep points of cluster algebras of type A, rank 2, Markov, and unpunctured surface type.

#### Old Stuff

For my MS, I wrote a survey paper on the [curve complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_complex). My advisor was Leah Childers.
