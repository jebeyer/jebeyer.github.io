### Mathematics

#### Research

For my MS at Pittsburg State University, I wrote a survey paper on the [curve complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_complex). <br/> My advisor was Dr. Leah Childers.

I don't have a doctoral advisor yet. My primary research interests are in geometry and topology, but I'm also interested in dynamics and mathematical physics.
