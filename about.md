### About Me

[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GteexAMUcl4p-Qd1MuFYPjpGtCoITJp4/view?usp=sharing)

I am currently working on a PhD in mathematics at the [University of Oklahoma](http://math.ou.edu/) in Norman. Previously, I got an MA from the University of Oklahoma, an MS from Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, KS, and a BS from Evangel University in Springfield, MO. I also worked as a geodetic engineer for a commercial satellite imagery company for 10 years.

In my spare time, I enjoy seeking out new music and creating noise using synthesizers and electric guitars. If you're curious, you can hear some of my recordings at [bandcamp](https://whistlingkitty.bandcamp.com) or [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/whistlingkitty).

As for what I've been listening to, you can see that at [listenbrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/user/whistlingkitty/stats/).
