### About Me

I am a graduate student in [mathematics](http://math.ou.edu/) at the [University of Oklahoma](http://www.ou.edu/), currently in my third year.

- MS, [Pittsburg State University](https://pittstate.edu/), May 2019
    * Mathematics
    
- BS, [Evangel University](https://www.evangel.edu/), December 2002
    * Major: Mathematics
    * Minors: Computer Science, Physics
    
Most of the time between those degrees was spent working as an engineer, traveling, and learning German in Hamburg.

I enjoy seeking out new music and creating noise using synthesizers and electric guitars.
